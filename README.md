# Sidcup Family Golf Website

## Description
This is a one-page animated front-end website inspired by Sidcup Family Golf.  
The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with GSAP animations to create a modern, interactive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- GSAP & ScrollTrigger  

## Features
- Fixed animated navigation bar  
- Full-screen background video  
- Custom cursor and blur effect  
- Infinite scrolling text animation  
- Hover-based interactive cards  
- Scroll-triggered overlay animation  

## Difficulties Faced & Solutions
- **Navbar overlapping content** → Fixed using top padding in main section  
- **Scroll animations not smooth** → Solved using GSAP ScrollTrigger with scrub  
- **Overlay not covering cards fully** → Used absolute positioning and inherit border radius  
- **Section height issues** → Replaced fixed heights with flexible layouts  

## Conclusion
This project helped improve my understanding of layout handling, animations, and scroll-based interactions using GSAP.
